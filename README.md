# Neural networks
* just mathematical expressions
* take inputs + weights

# Backpropagation
* efficiently evaluate the gradient of a loss function with respect to the weights of a NN*
* this allows to iteratively tune the weights of the NN* to minimize the **loss function** which improves the accuracy of the NN*
* basically a recursive application of chain rule backwards through the computation graph
